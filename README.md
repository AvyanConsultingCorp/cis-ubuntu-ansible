## Prerequisites

The role is focused on hardening an Ubuntu 14.04 system. However it has been successfully tested on other Debian based systems (Debian 8, Raspbian).

Install dependencies (on Ubuntu 14.04):

    $ sudo apt-get install pip
    $ sudo pip install ansible==1.9.0.1


## Usage

### Setting up the environment

The following commands are only needed if you never
Create a placeholder:

    $ mkdir ansible
    $ cd ansible
    $ git clone https://github.com/awailly/cis-ubuntu-ansible.git
    $ mkdir roles-ubuntu
    $ cd roles-ubuntu
    $ mkdir roles
    $ ln -s ~/ansible/cis-ubuntu-ansible roles/cis

Create a playbook in the roles-ubuntu folder:

    $ cat >>  playbook.yml << 'EOF'
    ---
    - hosts: all
      roles:
        - { role: cis, when: "ansible_version.full | version_compare('1.8', '>=')" }
    EOF

Create a file containing hosts:

    $ cat >>  inventory.txt << 'EOF'
    [projet]
    172.30.3.7
    EOF


### Running the role

Run the playbook with a version of ansible higher than 1.8:

    $ ansible-playbook -e "pipelining=True" -s -u ubuntu --private-key=~/.ssh/id_rsa -i ./inventory.txt playbook.yml

Note that this command will perform modifications on the target. Add the `-C` option to only check for modifications and audit the system. However, some tasks cannot be audited as they need to register a variable on the target and thus modify the system.


## Documentation

The details of each tasks operated on the target system is available in the [online documentation](http://cis-ubuntu-ansible.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). It is build on every commit based on the `docs/` repository content.
